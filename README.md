## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Built with ReactJS, Redux and hosted on Netlify, providing a smooth and responsive user interface.

- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) are used for secure user authentication, ensuring a safe and seamless login process.

- **Backend API:** I've used my own API(Hosted on Render) for authentication, getting the products list and details.
